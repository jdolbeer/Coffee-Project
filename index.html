            <p class ="opening">The taste of coffee is robust and extremely particular.  We've found a way to draw out flavors you can only get while camping, except we're bringing it to you locally.  There's nothing quite like a morning cup, roasted over a campfire.</p>
          <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>At campfire coffee, we're dedicated to bringing locally roasted beans to customers, paired with economically sound practices.<img class="right" src="imgs/campfire-family.jpg" align="right"/></p>
          <h2>Locations</h2>
